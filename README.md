# BlockProjection
Rhino Python script to project blocks (often entourage rendering elements) onto faces.

Currently not applicable to SubD faces, because there are only ["ProjectPointToSurface"](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/#collapse-ProjectPointToSurface) and ["ProjectPointToMesh"](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/#pointvector-ProjectPointToMesh) commands in [rhinoscriptsytanx](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/) library.

## How to use
1. Download the ".py" file;
2. In Rhino, run command "RunPythonScript";
3. In pop-up window, select the downloaded file;
4. Follow instructions in the command line to finish...
