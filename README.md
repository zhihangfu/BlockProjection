# BlockProjection
Rhino Python script to project blocks (often entourage rendering elements) onto faces.

Currently not applicable to SubD faces, because there are only "ProjectPointToSurface" and "ProjectPointToMesh" commands in [rhinoscriptsytanx](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/).
