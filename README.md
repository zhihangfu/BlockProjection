# BlockProjection
Rhino Python script to project blocks (often entourage rendering elements) onto faces.

Currently not applicable to SubD faces, because there are only "ProjectPointToSurface" and "ProjectPointToMesh" commands in [rhinoscriptsytanx](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/).

## How to use
1. Download the ".py" file;
2. In Rhino, run command "RunPythonScript";
3. In pop-up window, select the downloaded file;
4. Follow instructions in the command line to finish...
